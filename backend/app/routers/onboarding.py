"""Onboarding: "connect your shop" step shown right after a user's first
LINE login. For the demo this simulates pulling a shop profile + products
from the seller's existing marketplace account — Shopee/Lazada/TikTok Shop
Open Platform access all require a business-verified partner application
that takes weeks to approve, so this is mocked end-to-end (real HTTP round
trip, real network delay, mock-data backed) rather than faked purely on
the frontend with a setTimeout.
